# TS SPECT Firmware

This repository contains the Makefile and associated scripts necessary to build firmware for a specific project. The primary Makefile, named `Makefile`, orchestrates the build process and provides various targets for compiling, releasing, and managing the firmware.

## Repository structure <a name="repostruct"></a>

- [`data`](data/) : configuration files for constants used by the firmware (primes, curve parameters, etc.)
- [`doc`](doc/) : firmware and algorithms documentation
- [`fit`](fit/) : directory dedicated to evaluation done by FIT, CTU in Prague
- [`muni`](muni/) : (_obsolete_) directory dedicated to evaluation done by MUNI in Brno
- [`release`](release/) : compiled application and debug firmware
- [`release_boot`](release_boot/) : compiled firmware for EdDSA signature verification needed during TROPIC01 boot phase
- [`scripts`](scripts/) : scripts needed to generate constants, memory layouts etc. from configuration files
- [`src`](src/) : all firmware source files
- [`tests`](tests/) : all python tests, models and custom test vectors

## Prerequisites <a name="prereq"></a>
---
1. Cloning repository and setting the environment variable `TS_REPO_ROOT` to the repository root.

   ```bash
   # clone the spect firmware repository 
   git clone https://github.com/tropicsquare/ts-spect-fw.git --recurse-submodules

   # set env var TS_REPO_ROOT from root of repository
   cd ts-spect-fw
   export TS_REPO_ROOT=`pwd`
   ```

2. Ensure you have the `spect_compiler` and `spect_iss` binaries in the environment path. These are part
of the [`ts-spect-compiler`](https://github.com/tropicsquare/ts-spect-compiler)
repository.

   ```bash
   spect_compiler --help
   spect_iss --help
   ```

3. Ensure that Python and certain Python packages are installed on your system or python environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Build firmware <a name="fwbuild"></a>
---
The primary [`Makefile`](Makefile) orchestrates the build process and provides
various targets for compiling, releasing and managing the firmware. Run the desired build target using `make`.


1. To compile application firmware to `build` directory, use:

   ```bash
   make compile
   ```

2. To release application and boot firmware to `release` directory, use:

   ```bash
   make release
   ```

3. To compile MPW1 version of the firmware to `build_mpw` and `build_mpw1_boot` directory, use:

   ```bash
   make compile_mpw1 && make compile_boot_mpw1
   ```

2. To restore the state of the repository, use:

   ```bash
   make clear
   ```

5. For a complete list of targets, consult the Makefile or run:
   ```bash
   grep : Makefile | awk -F: '/^[^.]/ {print $1;}'
   ```

## Release <a name="release"></a>

Release application and boot firmware with

```bash
make release
```

This creates `release` directory with following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `spect_app.hex` | File | Compiled application firmware |
| `spect_boot.hex` | File | Compiled boot firware |
| `spect_const_rom_code.hex` | File | Constants ROM code |
| `dump` | Directory |  Program and symbols dump files for both firmwares |
| `log` | Directory | Compilation log files for both firmwares |

## Test/Simulate firmware <a name="fwtestsim"></a>
---
Python scrips for firmware testing and simulation are located in [`tests`](tests) directory. The scripts generates or read test vector, preload SPECTs input buffers and key slots, setup configuration files for `spect_iss` and run it.

Python tests expects firmware to be build before using `make`. Besides python tests, there are 3 scripts to run certain set of tests.

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| [`run_tests.sh`](tests/run_tests.sh) | Compiles and tests application firmware |
| [`run_tests_mpw1.sh`](tests/run_tests_mpw1.sh) | Compiles and tests MPW1 firmware (app + boot) |
| [`run_tests_release.sh`](tests/run_tests_release.sh) | Tests released firmware (app + boot), previously compiled to `release` directory |

### Test Vectors <a name="testvec"></a>

Tests are randomized by default. Test vectors are generated for each run using python models in [`models`](tests/models).

Test vectors can be also specified using YAML file and `--testvec` option to define parameters of test (private, public key, z coordinate, randomization). 

See [`testvec`](tests/testvec) for test vector examples.

> **_NOTE:_** Only [`test_x25519_dbg.py`](tests/test_x25519_dbg.py) and [`test_ecdsa_dbg.py`](tests/test_ecdsa_dbg.py) currently supports custom test vectors.


   ```bash
   cd tests
   ```
   
   ```bash
   ./test_x25519_dbg.py --testvec testvec/x25519_dbg_testvec.yml
   ```

   ```bash
   ./test_ecdsa_dbg.py --testvec testvec/ecdsa_dbg_testvec.yml
   ```

   The `test_*.py` file controls test execution, output logs generate in `tests/<test_name_directory>`
